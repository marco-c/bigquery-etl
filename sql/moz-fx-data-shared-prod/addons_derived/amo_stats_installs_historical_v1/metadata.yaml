friendly_name: AMO Stats Installs
description: >
  Daily install statistics to power addons.mozilla.org stats pages.
  See bug 1654330. Note that this table uses a hashed_addon_id
  defined as `TO_HEX(SHA256(addon_id))` because the underlying event
  pings have limitations on length of properties attached to events
  and addon_id values are sometimes too long. The AMO stats application
  looks up records in this table based on the hashed_addon_id.

  The hashed_addon_id is only valid for install_stats:

  NOTE: This table is a copy of `amo_prod.amo_stats_installs_v3` and is a historical record and should only be used if we need data prior to March 2024.

      For a more recent dates please use
      `addons_derived.amo_stats_installs_legacy_source_v1` for legacy based data containing clients with major app version below 148
      and `addons_derived.firefox_desktop_stats_installs_v1` for Glean based data containing clients with major app version 148 and above.

      `addons.firefox_desktop_stats_installs` is a view which combines `addons_derived.amo_stats_installs_legacy_source_v1`
      and `addons_derived.firefox_desktop_stats_installs_v1` and is the preferred method for accessing information related to amo desktop install stats.
